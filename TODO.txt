TODO: Use static_cast<>() instead of C-style casting for dealing with opaque types
	If possible.  They may be at C-level, where that function does not exist.
TODO: Clean up OgreInterface.h GameApplication.h function callback declaration
	Should only be declared in one way, in one place
TODO: Use define guards in C headers
TODO: Split agent.c into two separate ruby classes - GraphicsObject and Agent (with w/o animation)
TODO: Find out why key IDs fall outside of the expected range (much larger)
TODO: Consider increasing scale of all objects if shadows are scale-dependent
	Currently, shadows are very pixelated
TODO: Move as much of window setup as possible into BaseApplication.setup() and not go()

TODO: Default Agent to face down Y Axis, not X-Axis

TODO: Depreciate Oni::Window#setup in favor of just using initialize()
	Initialize will always be called after the window is set up, as that happens in the
	call to Ogre_Window_new
