Game engine using C and Ruby, built upon GLFW.

It should thus be compatable with Windows, OSX, and Linux.  However, the primary development
platform is Ubuntu Linux.

Dependencies
GLFW

Ubuntu install dependencies:
sudo apt-get install libglfw2 libglfw-dev


Inspired heavily by Gosu.  The word "Gosu" is Korean, meaning something like
"master", describing someone who posseses great skill.  The name "Meijin"
was selected because it is similar.  "Meijin" literally means "famous person,"
but is a title often given to persons of great skill, like high-ranking Go players.
Similarly, "Gosu" is used to describe high-level Korean Starcraft players, a modern
strategy game.
